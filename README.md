# ChangeteamFix
Fix for H2 team switching using a key command

In this case, using the Voice Chat key calls up the team selection menu. 

I got this menu call from the discord channel, credits to whom it may concern.

On the screen, a scrolling text will be displayed at the bottom indicating to the player how to call the team selection menu.

It has not been tested for a long time, maybe it could cause errors in some maps.


# How to implement.

Copy the file ""changeteamFixH2.gsc" into "user_scripts\mp" of your COD MWR folder.
